Mitigation Recommendations:

1. Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, expiration).
2. Implement account lockout mechanisms after repeated failed login attempts.
3. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security.
4. Disable unused services like SSH/FTP when not needed.
5. Monitor logs continuously using tools like Fail2Ban, Zeek, or SIEM systems.
6. Whitelist allowed IPs and limit remote access to known devices only.
7. Educate users to avoid using common passwords like "123456".
